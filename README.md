# How to Run the application

Set UserManagement.Presentation.WebApi as startup project if it is not set up yet and run it through visual studio or dotnet command.

Swagger page will popup with the availables endpoints to be consumed.

The database is a SQLite one and It already contains several records.

Pablo
